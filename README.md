# Duty Finder Assist Plugin for ACT
### Based on https://github.com/devunt/DFAssist

TL;DR; A rework of the DFAssist, forked from **wanaff14/ACTFate**.

### Why another rework?!?
It seems like wanaff14 simply stopped the development, and using an external tool (like the one from devunt) seems a bit like an overkill...
... We already use ACT for various things, so integrate this feature seems like a better option (:

### To-do
2. Inject toasts in game (to make it work even in full screen mode)
3. And/Or add TTS support?
