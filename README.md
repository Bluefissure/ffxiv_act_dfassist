# Duty Finder and F.A.T.E. Assist Plugin for ACT
### Based on https://github.com/devunt/DFAssist

TL;DR; A rework of the DFAssist, forked from **wanaff14/ACTFate**.

### Why another rework?!?
While we wait for the official plugin to be updated, I'll simply refactor this one, to ensure a more reliable and scalable solution.
